This project is a re-creation of a free code camp tutorial by author Rishab Kumar, referenced below.

https://github.com/rishabkumar7/freecodecamp-terraform-with-gcp

The main goal of this exercise was to learn to create resources like dns, cdn, load balancer, storage and a ssl certificate using terraform hcl. The workspace executed locally and currently does not have resource in gcp

Last run state: terraform destroy for all resources
